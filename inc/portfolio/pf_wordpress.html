			 WordPress, one of the worlds most popular publishing platforms, got it's start as a free, open source, database driven CMS. Over the years
			 it has evolved into a broader CMS used worldwide to power millions of blogs and traditional websites. Today it still rules the self hosted 
			 blog sphere and excels from standard and dynamic websites, e-commerce sites, news sites, and even some web applications. The key to WordPress'
			 success is the immense developer base providing aid through the codex, and more importantly developing free and premium themes and plugins. There 
			 is without a doubt no web publishing platform in history that comes even close to the shear quantity of 3rd party development available to the
			 WordPress community.

			After years hacking and rebuilding WordPress sites and themes I decided it was time to build my own theme. NinjaTheme is still under development but it
			will be a unique style of responsive theme. With content metered to both the height and width of the device it will be the first WordPress theme that
			I'm aware of that will adjust for any device dimensions, adapting at height based CSS breakpoints as well rather than simply basing its layout on device width. 
			This is for older devices that are smaller in height as well as new and unforeseen devices of the future - like smart-watches and beyond, and grants an 
			unprecedented control of content layout and user experience...
