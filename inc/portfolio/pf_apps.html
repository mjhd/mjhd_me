			Since the inception of the Internet, it has steadily taken over more and more of the common activities of our daily lives. 
			In today's world users expect more from online tools than their traditional counterparts, and online tools and applications are becoming more sophisticated and useful every day. 
			Piggybacking on what have become commonplace technologies, web technologies have become a go to solution for nearly all users who say to themselves: "There's an app for that." 
			More people turn to the Internet today than ever before, as the days of purchasing and installing a wide array of traditional software are numbered. 
			Online HTML based apps and tools with fully functional user interfaces supported by server-side applications have truly become the usability standard, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down. 
			Think of the last time you had a simple problem to solve, did you go straight to Google to find a website to solve your problem?
			Today you can convert a .wav file to .mp3 online, you can send and track invoices, maintain contacts, learn JAVA, edit images for Instagram, video conference, order food and electronics, take an IQ test, then design and order a customized pair of sunglasses without making a single phone call or leaving your house. 
			What's next? Good question - You tell me...
