		<p>
			 I began in the wide world of graphic design as a high school student, taking an ROP design course offered at my school. After learning Photoshop, 
			 Illustrator, some basic HTML, and Flash - I decided to really focus on Photoshop and learn it inside and out. As time went on I found I enjoyed Illustrator
			 even more than Photoshop and began a sharp focus on vector based designs with color usage and clean yet aggressive design being my hallmark. Since then my
			 taste has evolved, I've learned a great deal about classic design standards, modern and post-modern era renaissances, metrics, typography, composition, 
			 color theory and more. Today, even though I focus more on web design and development, nothing brings me more joy than some quality time with static images and
			 integrating far reaching stylizations into all forms of media. It is in fact, from the mindset of a designer I began in web design. Don't get me wrong, I love
			 succinct, sustainable, standard compliant and efficient code - but the end goal for me is always to produce something of great quality and appeal. This focus
			 is why even as a web developer, I will still always call myself MJHdesigner.
