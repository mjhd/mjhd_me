				Welcome one and all to my personal website - MJHd.info... I go by the name MJHd or MJHdesigner if you prefer, but you can just call me Matt if you like. I have been a graphic designer since my junior year of highschool, and have spent the past several years mastering frontend design and dynamic web development. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="display: none;">
				Since learning HTML at Palomar College in my early design days, I always had a strong affinity for the challenge of web design. Like print design there is a blank canvas element that is intoxicating but also a technical aspect that is always pushing into progression. Since the early days my focus has been largly on new technology, web standards, and mastering the more complex aspects of web development.
			</p>
			
			<p style="display: none;">
				I now split my time, freelancing between graphic design and web development. Which is just perfect for me because I'm not a big fan of compromise when it comes to what I want to accomplish. Now a days it's perfectly normal for me to spend half a day in illustrator, and the other half on notepad++ debugging PHP scripts in XAMPP...
			</p>
			
			<p style="display: none;">
				So for some info about me personally, I live in San Diego, CA. When I'm not working or stomping out open challenges on Codecademy, you can find me at Grandview or OB pier surfing or skating the new park in Encinitas. I have soon to be 7 year old son named Brad boy who is arguably the raddest kid in the world, and a cat affectionately named OC (Outside Cat). 
			</p>
			
			<p style="display: none;">
				So that's enough about me - please take a look around my site, make yourself at home, and if you're feeling it shoot me a line and tell me a bit about you! 
			</p>
			
			<p style="display: none;">
				Thanks for visiting :D <span>-MJHd</span>

								My first professional design placement was as a graphic design intern for a study abroad company called International Education Management. During my time at IEM I designed graphics, print layouts, landing pages and email notifications and newsletters.

								858 Graphics is a commercial small format digital printing shop here in the San Diego area. This was my first full time job in the industry, I was a pre-press designer and print operator. As time went on my role expanded to include creative design, in which I completed well over a dozen commercial designs for specific production purposes. This is where I learned to meet deadlines and work well under pressure, I was also exposed to some very unique processes and some got to do some of the coolest (albeit hardest) projects of my career.

								I began taking web development classes at San Diego Continuing Education at the beginning of last year. A free resource supported and staffed by faculty from the San Diego Community College District, SDCE offers courses including the Web Specialist Certificate Program, HTML5 - CSS3, Responsive Web Design, JavaScript and jQuery, & WordPress.

								Once I had made a firm decision to make the switch to a computer science major outright, I decided to begin at Palomar College. In addition to having the only CS major with emphasis in web development (CSWB), it also specializes in open source technology. I began the CSWB program early last year and am planning to transfer for a Bachelors once my GE coursework is complete.

								Since late 2013 I have been a web development contractor for The Impression Chefs, a San Diego based web development and design enterprise. Since starting with The Chefs, I have solidified a niche with frontend logic and specialized in JavaScript/jQuery solutions particularly as well as modern CSS3. I have also spent a great deal of time developing my serverside programming skills and couldn't be more confident in the results I've acheived since.

								Began attending Mira Costa College's MAT program majoring in graphic design. Although I left to change gears educationally, my time at Mira Costa was invaluable to my early development in graphic and web design. During my time here I took PhotoShop, Illustrator, Flash, and was introduced to HTML.

								Shortly after leaving 858 Graphics, I began the the DesignLab Project. It started as a name to invoice under for freelance projects. As time went on, I took to the name and came up with a logo and distinct style. In the past few years I have done everything from logo's to graphics for skateboards.

							<p>
								Late last year, the HTML5 spec was finally standardized and was gaining widespread acceptance among all the top browsers. Combined with polyfills for backwards compatibility, HTML5 and CSS3 were becoming the standard for modern semantic front end web development. SDCE offered a comprehensive 6 week course focused solely on the two and theory related to the need for a new (old actually) paradigm in thinking about markup and surrounding techniques.

							<p>
								Shortly after beginning at Palomar College, I was introduced to an online training resource called Codecademy. An at times frustratingly difficult online training environment, Codecademy focuses on learning in practical application and problem solving through code validation. Treehouse by contrast, is more of a step by step process with videos, quizzes and code challenges. I found the two complemented each other nicely, and kept me well ahead of the curve in my coursework.

								Since finishing my cert at SDCE, my major specific coursework at Palomar and having done extensive development work with the Impression Chefs, I decided the time has come to begin my new freelance project. As per the labratory theme, it's called the DevLab Project and as the name implies it will be the freelance web development lab. The website is in the works now, check back soon to see the final output!
