		<h1>San Diego Continuing Eductation</h1>
		<p>
			 is a member of the San Diego Community College District, which also includes Mesa, Miramar & City Colleges. It's aimed at workforce development 
			 and practical education for specific trades. Each of it's campuses are semi-specialized to industries they cater to. For example welding is taught
			 at the primary campus alongside electrician courses etc, while culinary classes, psychology and child develeopment are taught at another. The
			 North City Campus houses computer, networking, programming, web development/design, business, and accounting courses. It has the most extensive 
			 computer labs and a full networking sandbox for the various data networking/security/network admin classes. I have been attending courses at SDCE
			 for two years now and have found the specificity and short terms to be ideal for learning specific skills I know to be useful to me. For example
			 I was able to take a 6 week course specifically for WordPress, and another that was JavaScript, XML and PHP specifically for AJAX applications.
