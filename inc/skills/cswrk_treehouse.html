		<h1>Treehouse</h1>
		<p>
			 is an online web development, design, and basic programming educational service. It caters to people trying to be industry 
			ready but doesn't focus on conceptual depth of topics. I was however very impressed with the breadth and completeness of each section, and learned 
			things about CSS3 and HTML5 that weren't covered in my in class work. It has the advantage that it's curriculum can be adapted quickly to changes in
			standards, specs, or just common usage. For example when I took HTML5 basics they were already working based on HTML5.1.
