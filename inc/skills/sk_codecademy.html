		<h1>Codecademy</h1>
		<p>
			 is a top notch, in depth, learn by doing online service for a slew of programming languages and techniques. A bit out of the typical online
			 learning mode, Codecademy has no videos, quizes, or tutorials - it is code challenges only. It gives a brief explanation of what is to be learned
			 in each section only. The lessons are comprised of code challenges and objectives in a specialized editor that runs your code, checks for syntax
			 and potential bugs, and passes you to the next section once completed correctly. Much more difficult than other approaches but a trial by fire
			 technique forces users to problem solve, to make and deal with mistakes first hand, and apply their understanding to achieving realistic goals.
