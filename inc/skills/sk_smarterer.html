			 the online skill test for every language, library, technique, or skill. I was absolutely shocked at the difficulty and complexity of the questions
			 at first, and immeditaly realised I was going to have to put in some real effort if I wanted to score well. modeled loosely
			 after the SAT format, and meant to test skills of potential hires or freelancers, the pre-testing concept was born to aid those who needed to 
			 hire someone for a job that they weren't intimately familiar with themselves. The premise is simple, one expert 
			 community member makes a test, experts take and revise the test, the more high rating users who miss a question - the more it is worth. Then the 
			 test evolves becoming longer, harder, and more complex. Finally I come along and slam dunk every test I take! It's the circle of life :D
